##  Problem Statement

Amazon faces rising threats from:
- Fraudulent sellers & fake reviews
- Counterfeit listings
- Hijacked Buy Boxes
- Inefficient manual moderation

Traditional rule-based systems are not scalable or adaptive enough to keep up with evolving threats.

## Our Solution: Edge-Trust Mesh Platform

We propose a **Digital Twin Network** that uses AI + blockchain to secure each high-risk product (electronics, luxury, etc.) with:

- On-chain product identity
- Verified supply chain journey
- Tag tamper-detection via Edge-AI
- Scan-to-verify for customers
- Decentralized review validation

### Key Components

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
|  Digital Twin | A virtual copy of each product recorded on a permissioned blockchain |
|  Event Oracle | Logs product events (location, temp, time) from factory to delivery |
|  Edge-AI Vision | Uses CNN to detect tampering from macro photos of QR/NFC tags |
|  Scan-to-Verify | Buyers scan tags via Amazon app to verify authenticity |
|  Review Verifier | TinyBERT + MobileNet AI model runs on-device to filter fake reviews |
|  zk-Cred for Sellers | Zero-knowledge proof of seller identity and factory origin |
|  Reputation Engine | Computes a live trust score badge shown next to listings |
|  Graph Analytics | Detects grey-market or counterfeit clusters using path analysis |
|  Auto Takedown | Suspicious listings are removed or flagged in real time |
